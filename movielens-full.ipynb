users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items.\n","* When you have a very sparse matrix, with a lot of dimensions, by doing matrix factorization, you can restructure the user-item matrix into low-rank structure, and you can represent the matrix by the multiplication of two low-rank matrices, where the rows contain the latent vector.\n","* You fit this matrix to approximate your original matrix, as closely as possible, by multiplying the low-rank matrices together, which fills in the entries missing in the original matrix."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["> # Because we use big & sparse
